# WORDLE

In this repository you're will be found a desktop application created for the game WORDLE, this was made using electron in the development state, 
with an interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the logic of the game, this belongs to the Front of the App. In the Back, was created 
a connection with a database not relational in MongoDB, linked with Express throw Rest API, that allows the communication with the Front, for this 
communication in the Front it's necessary to install Axios for the request.

This project was created by Sebastian Meza and me for a class at the Santo Tomas University in the city of Bogot√° Colombia.
